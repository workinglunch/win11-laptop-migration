ðŸ’» Windows 10 to Windows 11 Laptop Migration Project

 ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains a complete set of project management deliverables for a simulated IT infrastructure project: the migration of 800 staff laptops from Windows 10 to Windows 11.

The goal of this project was to plan and deliver a seamless upgrade while minimising disruption, ensuring data retention, validating application compatibility, and providing post-migration support across the organisation.

The project was led in alignment with PMIâ€™s PMBOKÂ® Guide and represents a full lifecycle from initiation to closeout, tailored for an enterprise environment.
